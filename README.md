## 🔍 Features Used

- **Weekly Sales**  
- **Store Size**  
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**  
- **Fuel Price**  
- **Unemployment Rate**  
- **Markdowns (MarkDown1 to MarkDown5)**

---

## ⚙️ Methods Implemented

- **KMeans Clustering** for store segmentation  
- **Hierarchical Clustering** (optional/exploratory)  
- **ARIMA Time Series Forecasting** for sales prediction  
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and skewness

---

## 📈 Results & Visualizations
